## 🎯 Overview

This project demonstrates time series forecasting with real government data:

- **146,000+ rental records** from 2007-2025
- **Official CSO/RTB data** (no scraping required)
- **Multiple forecasting models** with evaluation metrics
- **Interactive Streamlit dashboard**

## 📊 Data Source

Data is sourced from the **RTB Rent Index** published by the Central Statistics Office:

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Table ID | RIQ02 |
| Publisher | CSO (Central Statistics Office) |
| Update Frequency | Quarterly |
| Coverage | 2007 onwards |
| Granularity | Dublin postal districts, property types, bedrooms |

**Why this is better than scraped data:**
- ✅ Legal and ethical
- ✅ Standardised methodology (controls for property differences)
- ✅ Official government statistics
- ✅ Historical depth (17+ years)

## 🧠 Statistical Methods

### 1. Linear Regression
Simple trend-based forecasting:
```
Rent = slope × quarter_number + intercept
```
- Easy to interpret (€X increase per quarter)
- Baseline for comparison
- Limitation: assumes constant growth

### 2. Prophet (Facebook/Meta)
Advanced forecasting with:
- Automatic changepoint detection (captures 2008 crash, COVID)
- Yearly seasonality patterns
- Uncertainty intervals (not just point predictions)

### Evaluation Metrics
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error (average € off)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error (penalises big errors)
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error

## ⚠️ Technical Considerations

**Note on Current Implementation:**

This project demonstrates time series forecasting fundamentals and data pipeline development. However, there are known limitations in the current approach:

**Univariate Modeling:**
- Current models (Linear Regression, Prophet) only use historical rent prices
- Real rental markets are influenced by exogenous factors: ECB interest rates, housing supply, employment rates, economic indicators
- Industry-standard approach would include external covariates (e.g., FRED API for economic data)

**Validation Methodology:**
- Current evaluation uses single train/test split (80/20)
- Production forecasting requires **walk-forward validation** (TimeSeriesSplit)
- Should simulate real-world usage: predict next quarter using all previous data, then roll forward

**Scalability:**
- Data loading builds entire dataset in memory before processing
- Works for 146K records but would fail at millions of records
- Production systems use streaming/chunking for memory efficiency

**What This Project Demonstrates:**
- ✅ API integration with official government data sources
- ✅ Time series data preprocessing and cleaning
- ✅ Baseline vs advanced model comparison
- ✅ Interactive dashboard deployment (Streamlit)
- ✅ Automated data refresh (GitHub Actions CI/CD)

**Planned Improvements:**
1. Add exogenous variables (interest rates, housing completions) via FRED API
2. Implement walk-forward cross-validation for realistic evaluation
3. Refactor ETL to use streaming/chunking for scalability
4. Containerize with Docker for reproducible deployment
5. Add ARIMA/SARIMAX models for comparison

This repository showcases data pipeline development and deployment capabilities. The modeling sophistication is intentionally kept simple for demonstrative purposes.

## 📈 Key Findings

From analysing 17 years of Dublin rental data:

- **2008 Crash**: Rents fell ~25% over 5 years
- **2013-2019**: Consistent 5-8% annual increases
- **COVID-19**: Brief 2020 dip, followed by rapid recovery
- **2024-2025**: Rents at all-time highs (€2,000+ average)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Data Fetching | Python, Requests, CSO JSON-stat API |
| Analysis | Pandas, NumPy |
